<h1>AICOR Virtual Research Building (VRB)</h1>


Welcome to the **AICOR Virtual Research Building (VRB)**, a pioneering hub where the future
of AI-powered and cognition-enabled robotics unfolds. Within the AICOR VRB, we extend
an invitation to delve into our cutting-edge research laboratories, including those in develop-
ment and dedicated to software components. Here, innovation meets collaboration, pushing
technology beyond its limits. Engage with the initial chapter of our interactive textbook to
discover the foundational principles and insights that guide our research, complemented by
practical programming exercises in the virtual labs. Explore the seminal work that underpins
our functional laboratories, offering a glimpse into how weâ€™re sculpting the future. Join us
on this journey to transcend the imaginable, today.


The **AICOR Virtual Research Building (VRB)** is an integrated ecosystem designed to en-
hance the development of AI-powered and cognition-enabled robotics. It supports the entire
innovation pipeline, from talent acquisition and training to leading-edge research collabora-
tion and knowledge transfer for economic and societal benefits. The VRB offers comprehen-
sive access to essential software components and the CRAM cognitive robot architecture for
creating operational robot agents. Education and training are facilitated through a learning
hub that includes interactive materials, video lectures, and a unique experimental infras-
tructure. Research is advanced via customizable virtual laboratories, fostering dynamic
collaborations and open-source contributions. Additionally, the platform encourages innova-
tion through industry partnerships and provides a framework for sharing resources and data,
underpinned by a Digital Research and Innovation Platform to drive continuous innovation
and sustainable growth in robotics applications.
