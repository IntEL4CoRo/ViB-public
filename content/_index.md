The AICOR Virtual Research Building (VRB) is an integrated ecosystem designed to enhance the development of AI-powered and cognition-enabled robotics. It supports the entire research and innovation pipeline from talent acquisition and training to leading-edge research collaboration and knowledge transfer for economic and societal benefit. The VRB offers comprehensive access to essential software components and the CRAM cognitive robot architecture for creating operational robotic agents. Education and training are facilitated through a learning hub that includes interactive materials, video lectures, and a unique experimental infrastructure. Research is advanced via customizable virtual laboratories that foster dynamic collaborations and open-source contributions. Additionally, the platform encourages innovation through industry partnerships and provides a framework for sharing resources and data, underpinned by a digital research and innovation platform to drive continuous innovation and sustainable growth in robotics applications.

The creation of the AICOR VRB is an activity of the Institute for Artificial Intelligence at the University of Bremen. The activity is supported by:

- The Collaborative Research Center EASE (“Everyday Activity Science and Engineering”) funded by the German Science Foundation (DFG);
- The European Network of Excellence Centers in Robotics euROBIN funded by Horizon Europe of the European Commission;
- The ERC Advanced Grant FAME (Future Action Modelling Engine) of the European Research Council;
- The collaborative project InteL4CoRo funded by the BMBF is developing an interactive textbook and immersive learning environment for cognitive robotics.
