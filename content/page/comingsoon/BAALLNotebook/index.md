The Bremen Ambient Assisted Living Laboratory (BAALL) ontology is a hierarchically structured ontology that has been developed over the past years for modelling
 - (dis)abilities and assistance by service robots (e.g. autonomous wheelchairs) for the Bremen Assisted Living Lab;
 - food, cooking, and diets, including dietary recommendations and restrictions.
 
In this laboratory you will see how to query a fragment of the ontology, and in so doing, also get an intro to ontologies and description logic.

of BAALL to get a better idea of the complete project. The BAALL ontology itself also has a <a class="btn btn-success" target="_blank" href="http://ontologies.baall.de"><b>website</b></a>. The ontology will be provided soon, under a suitable licence that will allow free use for academic purposes. Work is in progress to integrate its food related parts with the 
<a class="btn btn-success" target="_blank" href="https://ease-crc.org/soma/">SOMA ontology</a> and the
