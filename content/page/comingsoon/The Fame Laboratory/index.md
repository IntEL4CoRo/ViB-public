The FAME (Future Action Modelling Engine) Lab stands at the cutting edge of
robotics research, operating as a virtual research laboratory under the auspices of the
ERC project bearing the same name. This ambitious project is dedicated to
exploring how robots can conceptualize and deliberate on future actions to
preemptively address and avoid execution failures. A central focus of the FAME
Lab’s research is enabling robots to learn manipulation tasks by observing
instructional videos. This complex process involves the robot identifying essential
motion patterns within these videos, understanding the rationale behind their
effectiveness without explicit knowledge of the underlying physics, and adapting these
critical motions to its own operational context, which introduces a variety of
uncertainties. Overcoming these challenges would mark a significant milestone,
granting robots the ability to autonomously learn from instructional content, thereby
acquiring a wide range of skills and competencies. A practical application of this
research could enable a robot to adeptly cut any fruit, using any tool, for any
purpose, in any context, showcasing the potential for robots to achieve a remarkable
level of autonomous functionality and versatility.
