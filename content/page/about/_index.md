    At the heart of the virtual research building lies an operating environment tailored to support a wide range of research endeavors. 
    Here, researchers can interact with virtual robots, manipulate their configurations, and deploy software algorithms seamlessly.
    The environment is highly adaptable, allowing researchers to simulate various environmental conditions, test different control strategies,
    and evaluate the performance of AI-based algorithms in diverse scenarios. By running the research labs as Docker software containers,
    researchers can easily access and manage their experiments, fostering collaboration and reproducibility across different projects.
