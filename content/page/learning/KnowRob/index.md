KnowRob is a knowledge processing system designed for robots. Its purpose is to equip robots with the capability to organize information in re-usable knowledge chunks, and to perform reasoning in an expressive logic. It further provides a set of tools for visualization and acquisition of knowledge.

Description
---

KnowRob is a knowledge processing system that combines knowledge representation and reasoning methods with techniques for acquiring knowledge and for grounding the knowledge in a physical system and can serve as a common semantic framework for integrating information from different sources. KnowRob combines static encyclopedic knowledge, common-sense knowledge, task descriptions, environment models, object information and information about observed actions that has been acquired from various sources (manually axiomatized, derived from observations, or imported from the web).
