Differential geometry plays a crucial role in robotic manipulation by enabling real-time, energy-efficient movement while handling complex, non-linear tasks. It enables robots to navigate static and dynamic obstacles by representing motion in a general manifold space, where obstacles appear as voids. Unlike traditional Euclidean-based control, geometric approaches respect the natural curvature of motion, making them essential for tasks like in-hand object manipulation or fluid handling. By leveraging non-linear, geometry-aware optimization (e.g., Riemannian manifolds), robots can execute movements more precisely and efficiently, minimizing energy costs while ensuring optimal timing.

In human-robot interaction, smooth and adaptive motion is expected, often achieved through hand-coded interpolation of control inputs. However, a geometry-aware approach enables robots to natively compute non-linear movements, improving responsiveness and natural motion flow. For instance, Riemannian gradient descent incorporates lift and pull-back operations, preserving the intrinsic non-linearity of joint velocities rather than assuming linear variations over time. This approach enhances motion planning for multi-fingered grasping, obstacle avoidance, and articulated tool handling, making robotic systems more intuitive, efficient, and adaptable.

## Connection with FAME

### Main Goal

- Learnt from videos, aside from keyframe articulate movements, objectsâ€™ parameterizable geometry & physics/dynamics features are incorporated into the MPC problem of robotic hand object manipulation as constraints/cost-elements.


### Key Features

- Ensures real-time, energy-efficient movement for manipulation tasks.
- Enables static & dynamic obstacle avoidance for both mobile and manipulator robots.
- Translates motion into a general manifold space, treating obstacles as voids.
- Implements non-linear, geometry-aware force control (e.g., multi-fingered dexterous manipulation) in task space, in tandem with predictive sampling/optimization-based MPC.


### Challenges


- Both sampling and optimization-based MPC have their own limitations regarding robustness, intensive computation. Implementation typically requires careful design of parallelizing rollout tasks and powerful processors.
- Highly varied physical states and properties of objects, especially soft & deformable ones, during manipulation.
  - Infer most relevant features to be used in the control reward design.
- Object meshes, which are required for surface curvature analysis, are not always available.


### Solutions

- Implement reactive control using [Dynamic Fabrics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.08454) with flexible non-linear collision avoidance.
- Utilize MuJoCo-MPC as the baseline for the framework developed directly in C/C++, taking advantage of the highly-performant & physics-accurate engine API.
- Incorporate Discrete Differential Geometry (DDG) in object geometric analysis to help with providing more object-centric characteristic info to design more effective cost function for MPC task by coupling object geometric features + manipulation tasks.
