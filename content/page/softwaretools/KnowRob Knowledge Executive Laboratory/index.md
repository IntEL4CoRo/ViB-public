KnowRob is a knowledge processing framework designed specifically for robots.
KnowRob offers a comprehensive suite of tools for knowledge acquisition,
representation, and reasoning. It enables robots to organize information into reusable
knowledge chunks and perform reasoning using an expressive logic formalism.
Furthermore, KnowRob provides visualization tools and mechanisms for knowledge
acquisition, aiding in the creation of robots capable of complex manipulation tasks
and interaction within dynamic environments. This system stands out for its ability
to combine knowledge representation and reasoning methods with techniques for
acquiring and grounding knowledge, serving as a semantic framework for integrating
information from different sources and making it actionable in robots.

Description
---

KnowRob is a knowledge processing system that combines knowledge representation and reasoning methods with techniques for acquiring knowledge and for grounding the knowledge in a physical system and can serve as a common semantic framework for integrating information from different sources. KnowRob combines static encyclopedic knowledge, common-sense knowledge, task descriptions, environment models, object information and information about observed actions that has been acquired from various sources (manually axiomatized, derived from observations, or imported from the web).
