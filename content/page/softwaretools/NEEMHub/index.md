In order to make huge amount of data accessible to the research community, allow to analyze the data, create machine learning models from the data and support version control for the data and models, we have made an effort of releasing an infrastructure which can handle such requirements with one solution.

Description
---

[NEEM-Hub](https://neemgit.informatik.uni-bremen.de/neems) is a one stop shop for storing NEEMs and evaluate them by deploying custom models which can analyze data. It boasts [Hadoop](https://hadoop.apache.org/) big data support and [DVC](https://dvc.org/doc/start) based version control of large data sets. How you can access the NEEM-Hub is described in our [NEEM-Handbook](https://ease-crc.github.io/soma/owl/current/NEEM-Handbook.pdf).
