Description
---

[NEEM-Hub](https://neemgit.informatik.uni-bremen.de/neems) is a one stop shop for storing NEEMs and evaluate them by deploying custom models which can analyze data. It boasts [Hadoop](https://hadoop.apache.org/) big data support and [DVC](https://dvc.org/doc/start) based version control of large data sets. How you can access the NEEM-Hub is described in our [NEEM-Handbook](https://ease-crc.github.io/soma/owl/current/NEEM-Handbook.pdf).
