On Day 3, you'll explore the role of a knowledge base in robot decision-making.
You'll learn how to make queries to the knowledge base to determine the actions the robot must take to accomplish its tasks, such as perceiving objects in the environment.

<h1> Welcome to the third day of our hands-on course!</h1>
Today, you will focus on understanding how a knowledge base supports robotic decision-making. You’ll learn to query the knowledge base to identify necessary actions for tasks, like how to perceive the milk inside the fridge.

**Goal**: By the end of the session, you will have successfully made queries to the knowledge base, enabling the robot to determine the steps required to complete its tasks.

## Prerequisites
- Ensure you have a knowledge base system installed (e.g., KnowRob, Prolog).
- A basic understanding of logical queries and rules will be helpful.

## Theoretical Background
- We will provide an overview of how knowledge bases operate in the context of robotics.
- You'll learn how the robot can understand the need to open the fridge door to perceive the milk inside.

## Step-by-Step Hands-On Exercises
1. **Query the Knowledge Base**: Start by querying the knowledge base to understand the current state of the environment.
2. **Action Determination**: Ask the knowledge base, "What actions must the robot take to perceive the milk?" and interpret the responses.
3. **Plan Execution**: Based on the queries, plan the required actions (e.g., opening the fridge).

Throughout the exercises, code examples will demonstrate how to perform basic queries using Prolog or Python.

## Summary
By the end of the session, you will have a working URDF environment, and you will understand the process of creating and visualizing a simulated setup.

## Further Reading/Exercises
- For those interested in exploring more, we’ll provide links to additional ROS URDF tutorials and Gazebo documentation.
- **Challenge**: Try adding a new object, like a cup, to your environment and adjust its position to fit the scene. This will help reinforce your understanding of how to modify URDF files.
