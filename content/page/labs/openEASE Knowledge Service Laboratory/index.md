OpenEASE is a cutting-edge, web-based knowledge service that leverages the
KnowRob robot knowledge representation and reasoning system to offer a
machine-understandable and processable platform for sharing knowledge and
reasoning capabilities. It encompasses a broad spectrum of knowledge, including
insights into agents (notably robots and humans), their environments (spanning
objects and substances), tasks, actions, and detailed manipulation episodes involving
both robots and humans. These episodes are richly documented through
robot-captured images, sensor data streams, and full-body poses, providing a
comprehensive understanding of interactions. OpenEASE is equipped with a robust
query language and advanced inference tools, enabling users to conduct semantic
queries and reason about the data to extract specific information. This functionality
allows robots to articulate insights about their actions, motivations, methodologies,
outcomes, and observations, thereby facilitating a deeper understanding of robotic
operations and interactions within their environments.

Description
---

The information collected in the openEASE database consists of
semantically labelled episodic memories. In order to make use of it, and to
enhance it by additional meta information, we use and develop a set of
knowledge processing tools. One of these tools is KnowRob, which is the
base system for running the openEASE web console. It supplies a large
set of logical Prolog predicates that allow access to, and reasoning
about the information stored in the database. Furthermore, meta
information enhancing tools such as a labelling tool for recorded
sequences are available. In the labelling tool, sequences of recorded
activity can be annotated with semantic labels of what action was
performed, using which tools, and with which outcome. The collected episodic 
memories are uploaded to the [NEEMHub](/ViB-public/page/softwaretools/neemhub/).
