This virtual lab addresses the challenge of enabling robots to autonomously prepare meals by bridging natural language recipe instructions and robotic action execution. We propose a novel methodology leveraging <a href="https://vib.ai.uni-bremen.de/page/labs/actionable-knowledge-graph-laboratory/">Actionable Knowledge Graphs (AKGs)</a> to map recipe instructions into core categories of robotic manipulation task which represent specific motion parameters required for task execution.

Please select a recipe below to see the recipe instructions and what actions they are translated to, as well as the action parameters the robot would infer for action execution.

<p>
        Our objective is to empower a robotic system to autonomously prepare any recipe
        by systematically mapping each step in a recipe to clearly defined tasks. This
        website serves as a demonstration of our approach, illustrating how textual
        cooking instructions can be transformed into actionable subtasks for robotics
        applications.

<h2>Select a Recipe</h2>
    <p>
        By selecting a recipe on this platform, you will gain access to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Detailed Instructions:</strong> A step-by-step guide on how to prepare the selected dish.</li>
        <li><strong>Task List:</strong> A set of clearly structured and ordered tasks, derived from the recipe
            instructions.</li>
    </ul>

<p>
        Through this task-based methodology, we aim to break down the complexities of
        cooking into a framework that can be adopted by robots or any automated system.
        Our research showcases how strategic planning and task allocation can simplify
        culinary processes, leading to more consistent and efficient meal preparation.
</p>

<p>
        We invite you to explore our platform, experience the recipes, and discover how
        the integration of clear instructions and concise task definitions can streamline
        cooking for both humans and machines.
