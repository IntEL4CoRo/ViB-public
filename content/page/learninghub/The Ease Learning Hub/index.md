The EASE Learning Hub emerges as a pivotal educational platform, offering a wealth
of open educational resources specifically tailored for AI-powered and
cognition-enabled robotics (AICOR). This hub is a product of the collaborative
efforts of the research center EASE (Everyday Activity Science and Engineering),
dedicated to advancing the understanding and application of everyday activities in
science and engineering contexts. It serves as a treasure trove of knowledge, featuring
an extensive collection of video lectures that delve into various critical topics such as
cognition, robot perception, knowledge representation, and planning, among others.
Many of these insightful lectures were delivered during the international EASE Fall
Schools, making cutting-edge research accessible to doctoral students and other
researchers. Additionally, the hub provides numerous virtual training sessions and
tutorials focused on key software components essential for developing AI-powered and
cognition-enabled robot agents. This makes the EASE Learning Hub an invaluable
resource for students, researchers, and enthusiasts eager to deepen their
understanding and skills in the field of intelligent robotics.
