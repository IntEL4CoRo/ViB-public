”AICOR for Newcomers” is an innovative educational initiative designed to introduce
high school students and other interested individuals to the captivating realm of
AI-powered and cognition-enabled robotics. This program employs a visual
programming interface powered by [Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly), offering an intuitive and user-friendly
method for programming robots. Unlike traditional text-based coding languages,
which can be daunting for beginners and young learners, Blockly simplifies the
learning process, allowing participants to engage in programming activities without
feeling overwhelmed. Through this approach, newcomers are given the opportunity to
program robots within a virtual research lab environment to accomplish various
tasks, such as making popcorn, serving dinner, and going shopping. ”AICOR for
Newcomers” not only makes robotics accessible and enjoyable but also serves as a
dynamic platform for discovering talent and inspiring future generations to explore
the field of robotics.
