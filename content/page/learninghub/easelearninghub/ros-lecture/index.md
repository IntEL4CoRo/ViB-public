We also conduct lectures at the university that are already being utilized as examples. For instance, take a look at our GitHub, where we provide exercise sheets and environments for robot programming. These resources are designed to enhance the learning experience by offering practical, hands-on examples that students can directly engage with. By integrating these examples into our curriculum,
we aim to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application, ensuring that students are well-prepared for the challenges of robot programming in real-world scenarios.
