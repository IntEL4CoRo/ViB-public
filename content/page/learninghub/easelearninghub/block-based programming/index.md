Traditional text-based programming languages can pose a significant barrier to entry, especially for beginners and young learners. To address this challenge, we built a visual programming interface with [Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly) as an intuitive and user-friendly approach to robotics programming. This project aims to democratize access to robotics education and empower individuals of all ages and backgrounds to unleash their creativity in the field of robotics. Whether it's learning the fundamentals of programming or developing sophisticated robotic applications, such interface serves as a versatile and approachable tool for realizing innovative ideas in robotics.
