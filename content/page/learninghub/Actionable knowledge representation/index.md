The lecture course ”Actionable Knowledge Representation” delves into the
sophisticated realm of making abstract knowledge actionable in the perception-action
loops of robot agents. The course utilizes the advanced resources of the AICOR
virtual research building. This includes leveraging the comprehensive knowledge
bases of the KnowRob system, the interactive capabilities of the web-based knowledge
service openEASE, and the practical scenarios provided by virtual robot laboratories.
The course is designed to explore the methodologies of representing knowledge in a
form that is both machine-understandable and actionable, focusing on the acquisition
of knowledge from diverse sources such as web scraping, and the integration of
various knowledge segments. It addresses the critical aspects of reasoning about
knowledge and demonstrates how this knowledge can be utilized by different
agents—ranging from websites and AR applications to robots—to assist users in their
daily activities. The practical component of the course is facilitated through
platform-independent Jupyter notebooks based on Python, ensuring accessibility and
minimal software requirements for all participants. With course materials hosted on
GitHub, students are provided with an accessible and comprehensive learning
experience that bridges the gap between theoretical knowledge representation
concepts and their practical applications in enhancing daily life through technology.
