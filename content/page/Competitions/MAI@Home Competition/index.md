MAI@Home ("Multimodal AI Reasoning Challenge @Home") is a multimodal Embodied-AI competition proposed at ICRA '25. Here, AI systems are challenged to reason on multi-time spatiotemporal QA tasks in a daily living environment where your host human continuously changes the environment slightly.<br>
In this competition, submitted systems must process not only the current status but also have to “remember” and manage the status of the complex and dynamic environment, a crucial aspect for practical applications in the real world. <br>
One unique feature of this competition is that we provide spatiotemporal knowledge graphs and scene graphs in addition to the video footage, which can be considered a partial observation database that the agents can refer to as external knowledge.
<br><br>
For more information you can check out the <a href="http://ikgrc.org/2025/">competition website</a> and the github.

<!--In the notebook below you can try out some example queries on the knowledge graph and video data-->
