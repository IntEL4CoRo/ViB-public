The euROBIN Coopetition arenas represent a groundbreaking approach to robotics competitions, blending cooperation with competition across three distinct euROBIN leagues, each designed to address key societal challenges through robotic innovation.
In the realm of ”Robotic manufacturing for a circular economy”, the Industrial Robots League introduces a novel competition focused on robotic manipulation, featuring an industry-endorsed benchmark that utilizes an internet-connected electronic task board.
This board, equipped with a battery-powered microcontroller, meticulously records user interactions and task execution times, broadcasting this data to a public web dashboard and EuroCore for comprehensive analysis.
The ”Personal robots for enhanced quality of life and well-being” league challenges participants to push the boundaries of service and assistive robot technology, with a particular emphasis on applications within personal and domestic settings.
Meanwhile, the ”Outdoor robots for sustainable communities” league aims to advance the capabilities of autonomous delivery robots, covering both aerial and ground-based platforms, in support of creating more sustainable communities.
Together, these arenas foster a unique ”Coopetition” environment where innovation, collaboration, and competitive spirit drive the development of robotics solutions tailored to meet pressing global needs.
